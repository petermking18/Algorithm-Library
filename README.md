# Algorithm-Library
A collection of sorting and searching algorithms in C++. There is example code in `main.cpp` that demonstrates the usage of the library.
### Sorging Algorithms:
- Bubble Sort
- Merge Sort
- Insertion Sort
### Search Algorithms:
- Depth First Search (Iterative and Recursive implementations)
- Breadth First Search (Iterative and Recursive implementations)
- Dijkstra
- A*
### Travelling Salesman Algorithms:
- Brute Force (Naive approach)
- Dynamic Programming
- Genetic Algorithm
- Simulated Annealing
